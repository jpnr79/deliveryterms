# Quality Policy — DeliveryTerms Plugin

This project is committed to delivering functional, secure and maintainable software that meets customer requirements and applicable statutory and regulatory obligations. Our quality objectives are:

- Ensure reliable operation and correctness of generated delivery terms (target: 0 critical defects per major release).
- Maintain automated tests with a target of at least 70% code coverage for core functionality within 3 releases.
- Keep mean time to acknowledge and resolve critical defects under 48 hours.
- Maintain auditable records for generation, deletion and configuration changes to support traceability.

Quality responsibilities:
- Maintainer: keeps code and releases under version control and ensures CI is passing.
- Release manager: approves release candidates and ensures evidence is collected.
- QMS owner: responsible for quality policy and conformance evidence.

See `docs/qms/` for detailed procedures and evidence requirements.
